Okay team, let's get this Python data pipeline framework project scoped out. As the Technical Product Owner, my goal is to ensure we build a robust, extensible, and user-friendly tool that meets the core needs of defining, triggering, running, and monitoring data pipelines.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the requirements and the technical subtasks needed to achieve them:

## Epic 1: Core Pipeline Framework

### Requirement: Establish the fundamental building blocks for defining and executing data pipelines in Python.

#### Functional Requirements:
- As a developer, I want to define a pipeline as a collection of steps with clear dependencies.
- As a developer, I want to execute a defined pipeline programmatically or via a command-line interface.
- As an operator, I want basic logging output for pipeline execution start, end, and errors.

#### Technical Subtasks:
- Subtask 1.1: Design and implement core Python classes: Pipeline, Step, PipelineRunContext, PipelineExecutionEngine.
- Subtask 1.2: Implement the PipelineExecutionEngine responsible for traversing the step graph and executing steps in the correct order.
- Subtask 1.3: Set up the project structure, including pyproject.toml (or setup.py), dependency management (e.g., Poetry, pip), and basic linting/formatting tools.
- Subtask 1.4: Implement a basic logging configuration that outputs essential run information (start, stop, step execution, errors) to standard output.
- Subtask 1.5: Create a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) entry point (e.g., using argparse or click) to list and run defined pipelines.
- Subtask 1.6: Define basic error handling strategies within the execution engine (e.g., fail fast, continue on error per step).
- Subtask 1.7: Implement initial unit and integration tests for core classes and the execution engine.

## Epic 2: Extensible Trigger System

### Requirement: Allow pipelines to be initiated automatically based on various events (time, file changes, webhooks) and allow developers to add new trigger types.

#### Functional Requirements:
- As a developer, I want to associate a pipeline with a trigger (e.g., run pipeline 'X' every hour).
- As a developer, I want to be able to create custom trigger types by inheriting from a base class/interface.
- As an operator, I want the framework to monitor for trigger conditions and automatically start the associated pipeline runs.

#### Technical Subtasks:
- Subtask 2.1: Design and implement an abstract base class BaseTrigger defining the interface for all triggers (e.g., check() method, get_run_parameters() method).
- Subtask 2.2: Implement CronTrigger using a suitable library (e.g., croniter, schedule) to parse cron expressions and check trigger times.
- Subtask 2.3: Implement FileWatcherTrigger using a library like watchdog to monitor specified directories/files for changes (creation, modification).
- Subtask 2.4: Implement a basic WebhookTrigger requiring a minimal web server component (e.g., using Flask/FastAPI/http.server) to listen for incoming HTTP requests on specific endpoints.
- Subtask 2.5: Implement a trigger discovery and registration mechanism (e.g., scanning specific modules, explicit registration).
- Subtask 2.6: Implement a central trigger monitoring service/loop that periodically checks all active triggers and initiates pipeline runs via the PipelineExecutionEngine.
- Subtask 2.7: Define how trigger payloads (e.g., webhook data, file path) are passed as parameters to the pipeline run.
- Subtask 2.8: Add tests for each implemented trigger type and the monitoring service.

## Epic 3: Step Definition via Function Annotation

Requirement: Provide an intuitive, Pythonic way for developers to define pipeline steps using function decorators.
#### Functional Requirements:
As a developer, I want to decorate a standard Python function with @step to designate it as a pipeline step.
As a developer, I want the framework to automatically capture metadata about the step (like its name) from the decorated function.
#### Technical Subtasks:
- Subtask 3.1: Design and implement the @step decorator.
- Subtask 3.2: The decorator should wrap the user's function and instantiate or register a Step object.
- Subtask 3.3: Ensure the decorator correctly handles function arguments and return values, integrating with the persistence mechanism (Epic 5).
- Subtask 3.4: Integrate step registration with the Pipeline class definition (e.g., allow adding decorated functions directly to a pipeline instance).
- Subtask 3.5: Add tests for the step decorator, covering various function signatures and return types.
## Epic 4: Conditional Step Execution

Requirement: Allow developers to define conditional paths within the pipeline, executing certain steps only if specific conditions are met.
#### Functional Requirements:
As a developer, I want to define that Step B runs only after Step A completes successfully.
As a developer, I want to define that Step C runs only if the output of Step A meets a specific criterion (e.g., value > 10, status == 'SUCCESS').
As a developer, I want to define branching logic (e.g., run Step D if condition X is true, otherwise run Step E).
#### Technical Subtasks:
- Subtask 4.1: Enhance the Pipeline definition API to specify dependencies between steps (e.g., pipeline.add_step(step_b, depends_on=step_a)).
- Subtask 4.2: Design and implement an API for specifying conditional execution logic for a step, likely based on accessing results from previous steps in the PipelineRunContext (e.g., pipeline.add_step(step_c, condition=lambda ctx: ctx.get_result('step_a')['value'] > 10)).
- Subtask 4.3: Modify the PipelineExecutionEngine to evaluate these conditions before executing a step.
- Subtask 4.4: Ensure the engine correctly handles dependency resolution for conditional steps (a step only runs if its dependencies are met and its condition is true).
- Subtask 4.5: Implement logic to handle graph branching and potential joining of paths.
- Subtask 4.6: Add tests for various dependency structures and conditional logic scenarios.
## Epic 5: Automatic Data Persistence Between Steps

Requirement: Automatically persist the results of a step and make them available as inputs to downstream steps without manual developer intervention for saving/loading data.
#### Functional Requirements:
As a developer, I want the return value of a step function to be automatically saved by the framework.
As a developer, I want to declare the inputs of a step function, and have the framework automatically load the corresponding outputs from upstream steps.
#### Technical Subtasks:
- Subtask 5.1: Choose an initial default persistence backend (e.g., serializing Python objects using pickle or json to the local filesystem, perhaps organized by pipeline run ID).
- Subtask 5.2: Design a pluggable persistence interface (PersistenceBackend) to allow swapping out the storage mechanism later (e.g., database, S3).
- Subtask 5.3: Implement the default filesystem persistence backend.
- Subtask 5.4: Integrate persistence into the PipelineExecutionEngine: Save step outputs upon successful completion.
- Subtask 5.5: Implement logic within the engine or step execution wrapper to inspect the function signature of the next step and load required inputs from the persistence backend based on upstream step names/outputs. Store loaded inputs in the PipelineRunContext.
- Subtask 5.6: Define a clear naming convention or mapping strategy for how outputs are stored and referenced as inputs.
- Subtask 5.7: Handle serialization errors gracefully.
- Subtask 5.8: Consider basic strategies for handling larger-than-memory data (e.g., recommend returning file paths, initial support for generators/iterators if feasible).
- Subtask 5.9: Add tests for saving and loading different data types between steps.
## Epic 6: Web UI for Pipeline Visualization and Monitoring

Requirement: Provide a graphical user interface to visualize the structure of defined pipelines and monitor the status of ongoing and completed pipeline runs.
#### Functional Requirements:
- As an operator/developer, I want to view a list of all defined pipelines.
- As an operator/developer, I want to see a visual representation (DAG) of the steps and their dependencies for a selected pipeline.
- As an operator/developer, I want to view a history of pipeline runs, including their status (running, success, failed), start/end times.
- As an operator/developer, I want to drill down into a specific pipeline run to see the status of individual steps and potentially view their logs/outputs.
#### Technical Subtasks:
- Subtask 6.1: Choose backend web framework (e.g., Flask, FastAPI) and frontend technology stack (e.g., React, Vue, HTMX + Jinja2, plain JavaScript).
- Subtask 6.2: Design and implement a REST API (or GraphQL API) on the backend to expose data about pipelines, steps, runs, and statuses. This API will interact with the core framework objects and potentially the persistence layer.
- Subtask 6.3: Implement backend endpoints for:
    - Listing pipelines.
    - Getting pipeline definition details (steps, dependencies).
    - Listing pipeline runs (with filtering/pagination).
    - Getting details of a specific run (step statuses, timings).
    - (Optional) Retrieving logs/outputs for steps.
- Subtask 6.4: Implement frontend components for:
Pipeline list view.
Pipeline DAG visualization (using a library like Dagre, Cytoscape.js, React Flow, etc.).
Run history table/list.
Run detail view showing step statuses.
- Subtask 6.5: Implement data fetching on the frontend to consume the backend API.
- Subtask 6.6: Implement basic real-time updates for run/step statuses (e.g., using polling or WebSockets).
- Subtask 6.7: Set up basic project structure for the UI (web server, static files, build process if using complex frontend frameworks).
- Subtask 6.8: Add basic UI tests (e.g., end-to-end tests using Selenium/Playwright).
- Subtask 6.9: (Optional - Future) Consider adding basic UI authentication/authorization.
